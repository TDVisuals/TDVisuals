Hi there! Iâ€™m Taha, a high school student and junior coder with JPMorgan. Iâ€™m deeply interested in cybersecurity and aiming to make my mark as a Cybersecurity Architect. Iâ€™m also dedicated to becoming a skilled and proficient programmer. My coding journey began with teaching myself in my room every night and taking the Harvard CS50 course. Initially, I found coding to be quite challenging and time-consuming, but as I delved deeper, I started to appreciate the intricacies of how websites and software work. Over time, I have worked on various projects that have enhanced my coding skills. In my free time, I love playing the bass guitar and Iâ€™m also a passionate photographer, capturing the world through my lens. Currently, Iâ€™m working with Python and constantly learning new technologies. Based in New York and New Jersey, Iâ€™m always looking for exciting projects and collaborations. Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me.
