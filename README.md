Hi there! Iâ€™m Taha, a high school student and junior coder with JPMorgan. Iâ€™m deeply interested in cybersecurity and aiming to make my mark as a Cybersecurity Analyst. Iâ€™m also dedicated to becoming a skilled and proficient programmer. In my free time, I love playing the bass guitar and rocking out to my favorite tunes. Iâ€™m also a passionate photographer, capturing the world through my lens. Currently, Iâ€™m working with Python and constantly learning new technologies. Based in New York and New Jersey, Iâ€™m always looking for exciting projects and collaborations. Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me.
